# Copy Number Variation (CNV) Analysis from SNP Array Data

- This code was used to generate CNV calls for the [Facebase project](https://www.facebase.org)
- calls using three tools: VanillaICE, pennCNV, and DNACopy. 
- Rather than relying on one algorithm, we seek consensus among the three for more robust results.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- assumes data have been processed by Illumina GenomeStudio and results stored in FinalReport
- PennCNV
- DNAcopy
- VanillaICE
- ArrayTV
- bedtools

### Installing

```
git clone https://github.com/dpastling/facebase_cnv
```

### Tesing

TODO: find a small example file online
TODO: also need support files 

## Running the code

- modify the config.sh file 
- TODO: more info here
